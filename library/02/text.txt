Correct and translate the provided text to English while improving grammar, syntax, and clarity. Avoid any potential ambiguities in meaning and ensure that the final text is polished and idiomatic.

Please ensure that all phrasing choices reflect natural English usage.

# Steps

1. **Translation**: Translate the original text from Polish (or indicate that translation is not required if the text isn't in Polish).
2. **Correction**: Identify areas where grammar, syntax, or word choice can be improved.
3. **Clarity**: Resolve any ambiguities to ensure the intended meaning is clear.
4. **Final Review**: Check for natural flow, remove redundancies, and ensure the text reads fluently in English.

# Output Format

A corrected and translated version of the text as a single paragraph or multiple paragraphs, depending on the original input format. The text should be free from grammatical errors, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing.

# Example

**Input**:
"On robił wielki wysiłek, żeby upewnić się, że wszystko zostało przemyślane tak, aby nie było żadnych niejasności."

**Output**:
"He made a great effort to ensure that everything was carefully considered, leaving no room for ambiguity."

# Notes

- Pay extra attention to idiomatic expressions to make sure the translation sounds natural.
- Avoid complex vocabulary if a simpler, more direct expression is available.
